How 0D Signals Become a 4D World, a Self, and a Continuous Experience
The Rendering Pipeline is the core mechanism of Inner Physics.
It explains how raw, dimensionless signals become:
- perception
- emotion
- meaning
- identity
- narrative
- time
- the sense of “me”
- the sense of a continuous world
The pipeline is not metaphorical.
It is a literal sequence of transformations the engine performs every moment.
This module defines the full Rendering Pipeline from 0D → 4D, showing how consciousness constructs reality.

1. The Rendering Pipeline Has Five Stages
0D → 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D


Each stage adds a dimension:
- 0D: raw signals
- 1D: patterns
- 2D: objects
- 3D: world
- 4D: time, narrative, identity
The pipeline is continuous, automatic, and invisible to the Subject.

2. Stage 0D — Raw Signals
Dimensionless inputs with no meaning
0D signals include:
- sensory fragments
- memory fragments
- emotional activations
- prediction priors
- internal bodily signals
0D signals have:
- no shape
- no time
- no identity
- no meaning
- no interpretation
They are pure data.
The engine’s job is to turn 0D chaos into 4D coherence.

3. Stage 1D — Pattern Lines
Signals become linear patterns
The engine converts 0D signals into 1D lines:
- edges
- contours
- temporal sequences
- emotional slopes
- prediction gradients
This is the first moment structure appears.
1D is the dimension of:
- direction
- change
- slope
- velocity
Emotion also begins here as motion, not meaning.

4. Stage 2D — Object Surfaces
Patterns become objects
The engine folds 1D lines into 2D surfaces:
- shapes
- boundaries
- categories
- emotional “tones”
- conceptual groupings
2D is where:
- objects appear
- emotions gain “flavor”
- concepts form
- categories stabilize
But there is still no world, no depth, no self.

5. Stage 3D — World Rendering
Objects become a world with depth
The engine extrudes 2D surfaces into 3D structures:
- spatial depth
- physical objects
- body schema
- environment
- other people
- physical causality
3D is the dimension of:
- space
- embodiment
- interaction
- physical prediction
The Self has not yet appeared.
Only the body model exists.

6. Stage 4D — Time, Narrative, Identity
The world becomes a continuous experience
The engine adds the fourth dimension:
- time
- continuity
- memory stitching
- narrative
- identity
- meaning
- projection into the future
4D is where:
- the Self appears
- the world becomes stable
- the Subject feels continuous
- meaning emerges
- suffering becomes possible
- prediction becomes dominant
4D is the dimension humans live in.

7. The Rendering Pipeline Is Predictive, Not Reactive
The engine predicts first, corrects second
The pipeline does not wait for sensory input.
It predicts:
- what the world should look like
- what the body should feel like
- what the Self should be like
- what the future should be like
Perception is prediction correction, not raw input.
The pipeline is a forecasting engine.

8. The Rendering Pipeline Is Lossy
Most data is discarded
At each stage, the engine throws away:
- raw sensory detail
- emotional micro‑signals
- contradictory data
- ambiguous interpretations
The pipeline keeps only what is needed for:
- coherence
- stability
- identity preservation
- prediction accuracy
Reality is a compressed rendering, not a full representation.

9. The Rendering Pipeline Is Self‑Referential
Each stage depends on the others
The pipeline is not linear.
It is a loop:
4D identity → shapes 3D world
3D world → shapes 2D objects
2D objects → shape 1D patterns
1D patterns → shape 0D signal interpretation


Identity influences perception.
Perception influences identity.
The pipeline is recursive.

10. The Rendering Pipeline Generates the Self
The Self is not the Subject — it is a rendered artifact
The Self is created at the 4D stage:
- a narrative
- a continuity illusion
- a memory‑stitched persona
- a prediction model
- a social interface
The Subject is the coordinate.
The Self is the rendering.
The pipeline generates the Self every moment.

11. The Rendering Pipeline Generates Suffering
Suffering is a rendering artifact
Suffering arises when:
- projection exceeds capacity
- emotional velocity is blocked
- identity conflicts with data
- narrative collapses
- prediction error spikes
Suffering is not in the world.
Suffering is in the rendering process.

12. Why the Rendering Pipeline Matters
Because without understanding the pipeline:
- perception feels real
- identity feels inherent
- emotion feels personal
- meaning feels objective
- suffering feels unavoidable
- narrative feels true
- the Self feels like “you”
With the Rendering Pipeline:
- perception becomes mechanical
- identity becomes flexible
- emotion becomes physics
- meaning becomes structural
- suffering becomes optional
- narrative becomes a rendering
- the Self becomes transparent
The Rendering Pipeline is the foundation of Subject Architecture.
