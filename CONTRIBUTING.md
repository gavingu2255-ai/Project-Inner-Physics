# Contributing to Inner Physics

Inner Physics is not a code repository.  
It is a **structure repository**.

You are not contributing features. You are contributing:

- structure  
- rendering mechanisms  
- dimensional derivations  
- experiential dynamics  
- mathematical attempts  
- language‑folding models  

Submission process:

1. Fork this repository  
2. Create your structural file under the appropriate module  
3. Submit a Pull Request  
4. Explain how your structure aligns with the existing modules  

Important:  
Inner Physics does not accept “opinions,” only **structures**.  
It does not accept “explanations,” only **mechanisms**.  
It does not accept “stories,” only **rendering pipelines**.
