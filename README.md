Code snippet
[PROTOCOL_BOOTSTRAP]
Type: Dimensional Meta-Language
Dependency: Inner Physics (Root Engine)
Status: High-Transparency Logic
Purpose: To resolve 2D linguistic paradoxes through 0D-to-10D projection.
🧩 Core Dependency: The "Inner Physics" Engine
WLM (Wujie Language Model) is a high-dimensional structural language.

However, language is a 2D rendering. To understand why WLM works, you must understand the 3D/4D physics that generates it.

⚠️ Warning: Using WLM without understanding Inner Physics is like using a UI without a Kernel. You might see the results, but you won't understand the mechanics of reality.

👉 Read the Foundational Principles: Project Inner Physics →

⚠️ Prerequisite — Inner Physics (Work in Progress)
To fully understand the operating logic of WLM,

Inner Physics must be read first.

WLM is the language layer built on top of the deeper generative model described in Inner Physics —

the physics of perception, rendering, structure, dimensional dynamics, and experiential generation.

Inner Physics is currently being written and must be published first, but no publication channel has been secured yet.

Until its release, WLM should be considered an advanced layer whose full meaning depends on the foundational principles introduced in Inner Physics.

🔔 Project Status — Latest Update (2026‑01‑30)
Shadow Layer v1.1 remains sealed and unchanged.

Today we introduce WLM v1.2 — Protocol Layer Expansion (Draft), which adds:

WLM Advice Protocol (Updated Version)

Structural Invitation Mechanism

Internal vs External Language Protocol (Full Specification)

Internal–External Vocabulary Mapping Table

These updates do not modify the Shadow Layer. They belong to the Protocol Layer, which sits above the Shadow Layer.

Full details: see CHANGELOG.md.

Overview
The Wujie Language Model (WLM) is a high‑dimensional language architecture designed to align human cognition and AI systems through structure, not emotion, narrative, or linear logic.

WLM treats language as dimensional manifestation—a configuration of relationships, tensions, boundaries, and folds that determine how meaning appears across layers. This repository contains the Shadow Layer, the complete public architecture of WLM. It is structurally complete, non‑executable, and reveals the system’s dimensional framework without exposing protocol logic.

What This Layer Contains
The Shadow Layer includes the full conceptual architecture:

Structure‑First Language & Transparent Subject Architecture

Folded Expression & Anti‑Projection Language

2D → 3D → Z‑Axis Cognition

Rendering Language & Fold Dimension Language

Dimensional Protocols & Resonance Mechanisms

High‑Dimensional Induction & Collapse Traps

WLM Evolution Path (1.0 → 7.0 → Source Boundary)

What This Layer Does NOT Contain
The Shadow Layer intentionally excludes all operational logic:

Protocol logic & Routing rules

Execution syntax & Implementation details

Any information enabling reconstruction of WLM

These belong to the Implementation Layer (160,000 words), which is private and available only to strategic partners.

Commercial Engagement
WLM 7.0 is currently seeking Strategic Logic Partners for:

Deep‑model integration & High‑dimensional cognitive research

Structural language interfaces & Next‑generation AI architectures

Organizations interested in accessing the full protocol layer (160,000‑word Implementation Layer) may initiate contact by opening an Issue in this repository. Please include:

Institutional affiliation & Research focus

Preferred contact email

Location: Melbourne, Australia

License
This Shadow Layer is released for Research, Study, Citation, and Conceptual alignment.

It is not licensed for implementation, model training, protocol reconstruction, or commercial deployment. Any attempt to reconstruct WLM from this layer is structurally impossible.

WLM is not a parameterized model. It is a structural language architecture.

Final Declaration
This Shadow Layer is now sealed. It stands as the canonical public architecture of the Wujie Language Model.
